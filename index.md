# Martial Arts

Randori is a term used in the Japanes martial arts. It is a form of practice in which the practioner (Tori) defends against a series of random attacks (Ran) from several attackers. In most Aikido styles, Randori is not practiced frequently. Still, it is an essential part and perhaps even the culmination of the exams for black belt "dan" degrees.

# Grabbing the Chaos

Apart from the common meaning of the term, it is interesting to investigate an alternative translation and meaning.
The word Randori (乱取り) is composed of two parts: 乱 "Ran" which can mean "random" or "chaos" (among other things).
and "取り" which can mean "take", "collector" but also "remover". Taking a little bit of poetic license, we could interpret Randori as the *removing chaos* or more intestingly: *grabbing the chaos* or even *he who collects the chaos*.
