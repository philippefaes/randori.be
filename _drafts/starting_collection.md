# Not a Blog

How does one get started with a new Blog? A Blog sounds easy: it is a collection of chrological articles with a common theme. 

But how about a *collection of chaos*? How can one organize the chaos? Does chaos need to be organized, and is it even possible to organize chaos? And which media should be used? 

# Treasure chest

A collection of chaos would resemble a big black treasure chest in the attic of your grandparent's house. With lots of hand written notebooks, some chronological and some with a specific subject. Loose sheets of paper with lists, sketches, photographs and recipes. Each with their own texture, their own smell and their own history. 

Then again, if I had a treasure chest I wouldn't be able to enjoy my collection while I am sitting in a coffee bar across town or in a coffee bar halfway across the globe. So perhaps I'll settle for digital. 

For now at least. 

# Thermodynamics

The [second law of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics) teaches us that chaos does not want to be organized. Perhaps it is better to embrace the chaos rather than attempting to organise.

So here I start my collection of chaos, not in an old wooden chest but online. With neither structure nor a plan that allows for disorganisation; without any thought for visual design, and without an audience. 

It's about the act of collecting and not about the resulting collection.
