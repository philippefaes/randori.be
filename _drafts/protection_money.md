In my [manual for World Domination](/tag/world-domination/) I wanted to talk about levying taxes. Ordinary people would assume that only a government can levy taxes and they would be wrong. 

# Protection money
Asking for protection money is a popular way of levying taxes. Everybody pays taxes to the government, and the government claims to protect its citizens right? You can do better. Everybody who has watched "The Godfather" or any number of movies set in New York, Chicago or Sicily will know that private organisations have levied taxes in order to protect the people. But there are other examples. 

# Government sanctioned private taxes
With protection money, there is always a risk that people will feel that they can protect themselves. If you then try to convince them that they cannot, you're really shifting the scope of your business. However, there are ways to get government approval for your taxes. This usually involves some law requiring a specific action.

The best deal is if you can help the lawmaker write these laws. You will have a head start over the competition and you might even make it impossible for second movers.

In Belgium, companies are required to pay **food coupons** and **eco-coupons** to their employees (under certain circumstances, blabla, legal disclaimer). The coupons are issued by a private company and value of the coupon is less than the cost of the coupons. So in reality, you are more or less forced by law to pay this tax.



Why does this even work? How can you make a government write laws that make you rich? 
Usually, things start with a private company (let's call them Acme inc.) that has an idea related to the political agenda of somebody in charge. Executing this idea is way to complex for the government. They don't want to hire more civil servants and they might lack the knowledge of how to organize this idea. (It would be disrespectful to use the words lazy and incompetent, so we won't.) But, Acme inc can solve all these problems! They are not afraid to hire people and they have plenty of expertise on how to set up this new thing. Before you know it, there is a new law that forces everybody to buy Acme. services.


Can you think of other examples where private corporations levy taxes? Which mechanisms do you see in your country? Let me know below in the comments!
