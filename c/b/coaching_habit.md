![The Coaching Habit, Michael Bungay Stanier](/images/coaching_habit_v.jpg "The Coaching Habit, Michael Bungay Stanier")
I read *The Coaching Habit* as part of an assignment for my postgratuate course in coaching. In fact, I bought the book before I got the assignment, so I was planning on reading it anyway. Michael Bungay Stanier has the gift of simplifying. When you read his book, it seems almost easy to coach somebody. Anybody who has ever taken even an introductory course to coaching will hardly be surprised by the things that are in this book. The power of the book is that it states those things that everybody knows (but few of us practice) in such a simple way. Bungay Stanier offers 7 powerful coaching questions and techniques to get into the habit of asking these questions (rather than advising).

The book is easy to read and easy to understand. I think it will be good for me to revisit it in half a year and to check how much of the book I will actually have adopted as *habits*. 

## Takeaway messages

For the lazy people who are not going to read the book:

* **Coaching is simple.** Early on in the book, Bungay Stanier claims that *coaching is simple*. While that might be true, I would argue that coaching is by no means easy. Read the book, take a course and practice, practice, practice.

* **Build a habit of curiosity.** All the way at the end of the book, the author tells the secret of coaching: a little less advice, a little more curiosity
