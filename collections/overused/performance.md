# Misuse of the word Performance
The original meaning of *Performance* is (1) the "act of presenting a play, concert, or other form of entertainment", or (2) "the action or process of performing a task or function".

However, the word is used frequently to mean the *quality* or even a *measure* of the performed task or function. The problem is not that I don't like the word. Rather, I want to challenge the imprecise thinking that leads to the use incorrect use of the word.

For example: 

* The **performance** of this employee is below average.
* The **performance** of the new car is better than the old car.

In these examples, the *performance* is treated like quantitative measure of the performed task or function. The problem with this choice of words becomes obvious when we subsiture *performance* with *quantitative measure*:

* The **quantitative measure** of this employee is below average.
* The **quantitative measure** of the new car is better than the old car.

The obvious question here is: **which** quantitative measure? How do we measure the tasks that an employee performs? Are we looking at the car's gas milage, the torque, or its 0-to-60 acceleration? 

# Which measure?


When first faced with this question, some people will argue: "I mean *all* of the measures you mention." This is of course a falacy. If one performance is "below average" or "better" than another performance, the imprecision *grows* when considering multiple quantities. One would need not only to specify the quantities under consideration, but also how to weigh them together to get to the total *performance number*. 

In this context, without specifying the criteria, the term *performance* is a [Weasel Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word). It will convince many audiences of whatever the speaker wants to convey, but it shouldn't. 

I would like to invite you to challenge anybody who uses the word **performance** as a Weasel Word, and to ask for clarification.
